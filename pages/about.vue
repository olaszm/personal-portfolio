			Hi, My name is Martin and I am a front-end developer from Hungary,
			based in London.
		</p>
		<p>
			My largest body of work has been building front-end applications
			with React.js with various CSS libraries. I've also worked a fair
			amount with Django and Postgres in the backend while I was working
			as a full-stack developer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of work I enjoy üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è rock climbing, live concerts and reading
			about software developement.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to work with me, drop me an email so we can discuss
			about projects and ideas!
		</p>
