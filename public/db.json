    "my_role": "My main role was to implement the client's design and turn it into a modern and fast web application. On the back-end it uses Rails and for the database they used SQL. Fortunately, I could choose my tools to build the frontend, therefore I've used Vue.js. One of the biggest challenges regarding this project was to learn how a Rails application works and reverse engineer that. For hosting, we decided on AWS Amplify, because the backend was already hosted on AWS and they made it super easy to host a Single Page Application. For the payment it uses Stripe.js, state management is handled with Vuex and routing with vue-router. All in all, it was a fun project and I've learned a lot during development.",

    "my_role": "We worked together on the design and thanks to Figma's collaboration function I learned a lot about how to work closely with someone who has experience in design.He needed internationalization to reach both Hungarian and English speaking costumers. I'm a big fan of Vue.js so I knew vue-i18n will be the perfect solution for this problem. He also wanted people to reach him using a contact form on his website. For this initially, I wanted to use SendGrid, but unfortunately, He already paid for a hosting platform for a year, so we ended up using PHP for the form submit. Transitions were made with GSAP and Vue Transitions. Eventually, he's going to extend with a gallery and some case studies where I'm planning to use Contentful as a CMS.  ",

    "my_role": "I've done a couple of e-commerce websites from scratch before but never integrated any payment system, so for this project, I used Stripe's Stripe.js library. The library has many functions, but thankfully their documentations is easy to use and very straightforward, so it did not cause any problems to integrate the payment method(Of course ,it's just a test API, it doesn't charge you). On the front-end I used Vue with vuex and router, for CMS I used Contentful and I'm hosting on heroku.(sorry ☹)",
